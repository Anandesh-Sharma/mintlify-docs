title: 'Delete Event'
openapi: 'DELETE /events/{event_id}'
---

This endpoint allows you to remove events that are no longer needed from your active listings.

**What it does:**
- Marks an event as deleted in the system (soft delete)
- Keeps the event data in the database but hides it from normal listings
- Changes the event's `is_deleted` status to `true`

**When to use it:**
- When an event has been canceled
- When you created an event by mistake
- When you want to clean up your event listings
- When you want to archive old events but retain their data

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `event_id` | string | Yes | The unique identifier of the event to delete |

## Response

The API returns the updated event object with `is_deleted` set to `true`:

```json
{
  "id": "event-123",
  "title": "Annual Tech Conference",
  "description": "Join us for the annual tech conference featuring speakers from top tech companies",
  "instructions": "Please arrive 30 minutes before the event starts for registration",
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/event-image.jpg",
  "location": {
    "address": "123 Conference Center Dr",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA",
    "zipCode": "94105",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "start_timestamp": 1677609600,
  "end_timestamp": 1677696000,
  "type": "dated",
  "is_deleted": true,
  "created_at": "2023-02-28T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Note:** This is a soft delete operation. The event data is preserved in the system but will no longer appear in the regular event listings. This allows you to maintain historical records while cleaning up your active events.
