- Returns comprehensive information about both the invitation and the event

**When to use it:**

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `session_id` | string | No | The unique session identifier |
| `invite_id` | string | No | The unique invite identifier |

You must provide either `session_id` or `invite_id`, but not necessarily both.
