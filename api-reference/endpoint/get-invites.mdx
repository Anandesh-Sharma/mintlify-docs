**Invite status meanings:**
- `pending`: Invitation has been created but not sent yet
- `sent`: Invitation has been sent but no response yet
- `accepted`: Invitee has accepted the invitation
- `rejected`: Invitee has declined the invitation

**Tip:** To get only accepted invitations (for creating a guest list), include `?status=accepted` in your query.
