title: 'Get Token'
openapi: 'GET /get-token'
---

This endpoint generates a temporary authentication token that you can use for subsequent API calls. While most endpoints use the x-api-key header for authentication, some operations require a temporary token.

**What it does:**
- Generates a short-lived access token for API authentication
- Returns details about the token including its expiration time
- Creates credentials that can be passed to client-side applications

**When to use it:**
- When you need a temporary token for security reasons
- For client-side applications that shouldn't store your permanent API key
- When you want to grant limited-time access to the API
- For implementing proper token-based authentication flows

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_id` | string | Yes | The unique identifier of the collection |

## Response

The API returns a token object with the authentication token and its expiration time:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

The token is valid for the specified expiration time (in seconds). After it expires, a new token must be requested.

## Usage

Include this token in the Authorization header of subsequent API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Security tip:** These tokens are temporary by design. Don't store them permanently, and always implement proper token refresh mechanisms in your application.
