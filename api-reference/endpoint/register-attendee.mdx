title: 'Register Attendee'
openapi: 'POST /register-attendee/{event_id}'
---

This endpoint allows you to directly register someone for an event without going through the invitation process. This is useful for on-site registrations or when you're managing attendees directly.

**What it does:**
- Adds a new attendee directly to an event
- Creates a complete attendee record with all necessary information
- Bypasses the invitation flow (useful for immediate registrations)

**When to use it:**
- For on-site registration at event check-in
- When an admin needs to manually add attendees
- When you want to skip the invitation process
- For bulk importing attendees from another system

}
```

## Response

Upon successful registration, the API returns a success response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Attendee registered successfully",
  "attendee_id": "attendee-123"
}
```

**Important note:** The `img_url` field is particularly important for Securegate's facial recognition system. This is the reference image that will be used to verify the attendee's identity during check-in. Make sure it's a clear, front-facing photo of the person.
