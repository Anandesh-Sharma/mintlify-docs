## API Structure

Our API is organized into several functional areas:

- **Event Management**: Create, retrieve, and manage events
- **Attendee Management**: Register attendees and retrieve attendee information
- **Invite Management**: Create and manage invitations for events
- **Authentication & Identity**: Generate authentication tokens and verify identity

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys. You need to include your API key in the `x-api-key` header of each request.

```json
// Include this in your API requests
{
  "headers": {
    "x-api-key": "your_api_key_here"
  }
}
```

To obtain an API key, please contact our support team.

### API Playground Authentication

When using the API playground in this documentation:

1. Click the "Headers" button below the endpoint URL
2. Add a new header with key `x-api-key` and value `your_api_key_here`

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Each API key has a quota of 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.
