## Overview

Securegate.ai provides APIs for managing secure events with advanced identity verification. Our platform helps you:

- Create and manage events (conferences, access-controlled locations, etc.)
- Send and track invitations to attendees
- Register and verify attendees using biometric authentication
- Control access to secure locations with facial recognition

Think of it as an end-to-end system for running events where security and identity verification are important.

## API Structure

Our API is organized into four main areas, reflecting the typical workflow:

- **Event Management**: First, create and configure your events
- **Attendee Management**: Register and manage the people attending your events
- **Invite Management**: Send and track invitations for controlled access
- **Authentication & Identity**: Verify identities with biometric data

## Authentication

All API endpoints require an API key for security. Include your key in the `x-api-key` header of each request:

```json
// Include this in your API requests
{
  "headers": {
    "x-api-key": "your_api_key_here"
  }
}
```

To obtain an API key, please contact our support team.

### API Playground Authentication

When using the API playground in this documentation:

1. Click the "Headers" button below the endpoint URL
2. Add a new header with key `x-api-key` and value `your_api_key_here`

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Each API key has a quota of 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.
