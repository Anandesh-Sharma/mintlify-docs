## API Structure

Our API is organized into several functional areas:

- **Event Management**: Create, retrieve, and manage events
- **Attendee Management**: Register attendees and retrieve attendee information
- **Invite Management**: Create and manage invitations for events
- **Authentication & Identity**: Generate authentication tokens and verify identity

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You can obtain a token using the [Get Token](/api-reference/endpoint/get-token) endpoint.

```json
// Include this in your API requests
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_access_token_here"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Each API key has a quota of 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.
